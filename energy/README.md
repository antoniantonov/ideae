## Kinetic energy device
The idea is to combine this kind of (kinetic energy storage)[https://youtu.be/trA5s2iGj2A?si=z4-X3lvuDFEpVBW9&t=1422] but with a twist. Literally. 
We can elevate the weight but then add a spiral cut rod (think of a giant bold) and let the wight spin and this way lower itself down. 
It should be way slower and the spin itself will generate energy. Feels like this should produce more energy than we put in it. 
(I make an assumption that simply lowering the weight as in the video, will produce somewhat comparable amount of energy of what we put in the system to lift the weight).

1. Lift the weight straight up with a crane.
2. Once up, put it on top of the thread. Think of a threaded rod that goes in the middle of the weight.
3. When you need energy:
   - Spin the weight (from a small battery that is on site)
   - Attach it to the rod
   - The weight by the force of gravity will go down the thread but keep spining. The spin generates energy.
4. If we want to stop it we can deploy blades or air brakes (depends on the spin speed) + some kind of brake.
5. Once complete down
   - Detach from the rod (think about this)
   - Go to 1.
